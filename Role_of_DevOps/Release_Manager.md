# **Release Manager**

Release managers are responsible for the management and coordination of the product from development through production. While similar to project managers, these staff members handle technical details a traditional PM cannot manage. Release managers must:

- Oversee the coordination, integration, and progress of development, testing, and deployment.
- Support continuous delivery by implementing agile processes.
- Maintain the end-to-end application delivery toolchain.
- Measure and interpret DevOps metrics and KPIs.

Other common names for a release manager are a release engineer or a product stability manager.

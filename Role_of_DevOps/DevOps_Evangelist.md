# **DevOps_Evangelist**

An evangelist is the change agent who promotes and orchestrates the DevOps culture across an organization. This person is responsible for initiating DevOps adoption and proactively improving the team. An evangelist must:

- Advocate the benefits of DevOps by identifying and quantifying the business impacts.

- Ensure executives, development, and operations departments buy into the DevOps transition.

- Identify the roles to support optimal software delivery.

- Ensure IT staff have sufficient DevOps training.

- Eliminate silos from IT delivery and operations.

- Create integration and orchestration blueprints.

- Select the right DevOps tools for the team.

Transitioning to DevOps requires nurturing a learning culture in which a team repeatedly fails, learns from mistakes, and improves. This cycle starts with the DevOps evangelist.

An evangelist is essential at the start of the DevOps journey. Once a company embraces the new way of working, the evangelist continues to find ways to improve the pipeline architecture.

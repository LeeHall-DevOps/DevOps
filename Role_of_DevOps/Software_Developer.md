# Software Developer

Software developers write product code. However, in a DevOps culture, a developerâ€™s scope of responsibilities expands. A DevOps software developer must:

- Write front-end and back-end code for new releases.

- Launch unit testing.

- Work with QA to ensure the code is bug-free before delivery.

- Monitor the pipeline for issues and potential improvement opportunities.

# QA and XA Experts

While software developers are responsible for some testing, a DevOps team still requires a dedicated QA (quality assurance) department. DevOps QA testers are responsible for:

- Testing and verifying releases.
- Documenting bug reports.
- Ensuring features and functions align with design specs.

A strong DevOps testing structure also requires an XA (experience assurance) expert. Whereas QA personnel tests code for functionality, XA staff ensures new features do not negatively affect the end-user experience.

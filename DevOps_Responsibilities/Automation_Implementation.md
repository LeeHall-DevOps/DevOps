# Automation Implementation

A DevOps engineer uses automation to make software development consistent, reliable, and efficient. Automation is present at every phase of the software lifecycle, from build triggering and unit testing to packaging and deploying to environments.

Automation allows a DevOps team to quickly and easily:

- Accelerate pipeline processes.
- Scale environments.
- Set up and manage infrastructure.
- Alter CI/CD workflows.
- Run reliable tests.
- Monitor the pipeline.

Automation eliminates repetitive manual assignments. The lack of recurring tasks keeps the staff happy, while pipelines become more stable and efficient.

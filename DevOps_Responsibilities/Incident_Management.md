# Incident Management

Responding and resolving incidents is an essential DevOps responsibility. Incident management keeps the code and infrastructure safe while ensuring the pipeline does not slow down. A typical response strategy has five stages:

- <b>Detection:</b> DevOps engineers set up alert tools and systems to detect anomalies. Most teams have runbooks that inform the staff about the go-to contact in case of an incident.

- <b>Response:</b> A DevOps team typically assigns multiple engineers to be available for escalations. If the on-call team member cannot resolve the problem, the engineer can bring in the right people to assess the impact.

- <b>Resolution:</b> Ideally, DevOps engineers resolve incidents before the problem has a chance to impact the rest of the pipeline.

- <b>Analysis:</b> Whenever a team resolves an issue, engineers analyze the root cause and the response tactic. The goal is to improve system resilience and the teamâ€™s ability to detect and respond to incidents.

- <b>Readiness:</b> The team reinforces the system and prevents similar issues from occurring in the future.

# Monitoring

Monitoring allows an engineer to analyze the performance and stability of applications and infrastructure throughout the software lifecycle. This responsibility consists of several processes:

- <b>Logging:</b> Logging provides teams with data about critical components. Application logs, infrastructure logs, and audit logs help teams learn about and improve products.

- <b>Alerting:</b> Alerting notifies the team and helps engineers stay ahead of issues. Alerts provide debugging information to help solve problems quickly.

- <b>Tracing:</b> Tracing provides performance and behavioral insights that can improve the stability and scalability of apps in production.

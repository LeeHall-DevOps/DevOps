# Deployment

Deployment is the act of installing and setting up a version of the software onto a target environment. The software version can be a:

- <b>Internal release:</b> A release that does not go outside of the development team (e.g., software for QA or demo projects).

- <b>External release:</b> A release for customers and end-users in production. 

- <b>Development versions:</b> In-progress code a team deploys for development purposes.

The responsibility of deploying software either belongs to a specific engineer(s), or a team sets up continuous deployment to automate software releases. With CD, every code change passes through automated tests and deploys to production automatically.

Continuous deployment eliminates the need for scheduled releases. The feedback loop is also quicker, so developers can address issues with more agility and accuracy.

Setting up and maintaining automatic deployments is challenging. If the team is not ready to take on this responsibility, the company should perfect continuous integration and delivery first.

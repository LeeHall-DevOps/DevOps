# App_and_Infract_Testing

The importance of continuous testing (or shift-left testing) grows as release cycles get shorter. DevOps engineers in charge of tests set up tools, practices, and processes that inspect code early in the pipeline and resolve issues quickly.

The goal of continuous testing is to:

- Increase code quality.
- Create more reliable pipelines.
- Shorten test cycles.
- Keep software defects away from production.

Here are the most common tests DevOps teams run:

- <b>Unit testing:</b> Unit tests get fast feedback on new code. This form of testing focuses on isolated components that are easy to debug and fix.

- <b>Integration testing:</b> Integration tests happen once components merge into the shared pipeline. These tests ensure that the build stays stable with new code additions.

- <b>End-to-end and regression testing:</b> DevOps engineers run these tests by deploying finalized code to different servers and resources. End-to-end and regression tests check if the application works in a production-like environment.

- <b>Production testing:</b> Production tests run after the application release to check for stability.
